## :pushpin: Overview

`TopoBench` (TB) is a modular Python library designed to standardize benchmarking and accelerate research in Topological Deep Learning (TDL). In particular, TB allows to train and compare the performances of all sorts of Topological Neural Networks (TNNs) across the different topological domains, where by _topological domain_ we refer to a graph, a simplicial complex, a cellular complex, or a hypergraph. For detailed information, please refer to the [`TopoBench: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06642) paper.

<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/workflow.jpg" width="700">
</p>

The main pipeline trains and evaluates a wide range of state-of-the-art TNNs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (see <a href="#gear-neural-networks">:gear: Neural Networks</a>) on numerous and varied datasets and benchmark tasks (see <a href="#books-datasets">:books: Datasets</a> ). Additionally, the library offers the ability to transform, i.e. _lift_, each dataset from one topological domain to another (see <a href="#rocket-liftings">:rocket: Liftings</a>), enabling for the first time an exhaustive inter-domain comparison of TNNs.

## :jigsaw: Get Started

### Create Environment

If you do not have conda on your machine, please follow [their guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) to install it. 

First, clone the `TopoBench` repository and set up a conda environment `tb` with python 3.11.3. 

```
git clone git@github.com:geometric-intelligence/topobench.git
cd TopoBench
conda create -n tb python=3.11.3
```

Next, check the CUDA version of your machine:
```
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --version
```
and ensure that it matches the CUDA version specified in the `env_setup.sh` file (`CUDA=cu121` by default). If it does not match, update `env_setup.sh` accordingly by changing both the `CUDA` and `TORCH` environment variables to compatible values as specified on [this website](https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib).

Next, set up the environment with the following command.

```
source env_setup.sh
```
This command installs the `TopoBench` library and its dependencies. 

### Run Training Pipeline

Next, train the neural networks by running the following command:

```
python -m topobench 
```

Thanks to `hydra` implementation, one can easily override the default experiment configuration through the command line. For instance, the model and dataset can be selected as:

```
python -m topobench model=cell/cwn dataset=graph/MUTAG
```

**Remark:** By default, our pipeline identifies the source and destination topological domains, and applies a default lifting between them if required.

The same CLI override mechanism also applies when modifying more finer configurations within a `CONFIG GROUP`. Please, refer to the official [`hydra`documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) for further details.



## :bike: Experiments Reproducibility
To reproduce Table 1 from the [`TopoBench: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06642) paper, please run the following command:

```
bash scripts/reproduce.sh
```
**Remark:** We have additionally provided a public [W&B (Weights & Biases) project](https://wandb.ai/telyatnikov_sap/TopoBenchmark_main?nw=nwusertelyatnikov_sap) with logs for the corresponding runs (updated on June 11, 2024).


## :anchor: Tutorials

Explore our [tutorials](https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/tree/main/tutorials) for further details on how to add new datasets, transforms/liftings, and benchmark tasks. 

## :gear: Neural Networks

We list the neural networks trained and evaluated by `TopoBench`, organized by the topological domain over which they operate: graph, simplicial complex, cellular complex or hypergraph. Many of these neural networks were originally implemented in [`TopoModelX`](https://github.com/pyt-team/TopoModelX).

Please check out the extended [TopoTune wiki page](https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/wiki/TopoTune) for further details on how to leverage this framework to define and train customized topological neural network architectures.


## :rocket: Liftings & Transforms

We list the liftings used in `TopoBench` to transform datasets. Here, a _lifting_ refers to a function that transforms a dataset defined on a topological domain (_e.g._, on a graph) into the same dataset but supported on a different topological domain (_e.g._, on a simplicial complex).

<summary><b> Structural Liftings </b></summary>

We enumerate below the structural liftings currently implemented in `TopoBench` --taxonomized by source and destination topological domains. Please check out the provided description links for further details. 

**Remark:**: Most of these liftings are adaptations of winner submissions of the ICML TDL Challenge 2024 ([paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v251/bernardez24a.html) | [repo](https://github.com/pyt-team/challenge-icml-2024)); see the [Structural Liftings wiki](https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/wiki/Structural-Liftings) for a complete list of compatible liftings.
